            <p>
              Founded by USC students who saw the gap between cutting-edge technology and the organizations that needed it most, Trojan Technology Solutions has grown into a thriving community of changemakers.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a small group of students working on a single project has evolved into a comprehensive consulting organization, completing over 15 projects for partner organizations across education, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and social justice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we continue to push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible when technology meets purpose, empowering both our student members and our community partners to achieve more together.
